# ElasticSTAR 🛑 Project Sunset Notice (May 2025)

This project has been **officially sunset** as of May 2025.  
While it successfully demonstrated a working pipeline for personal knowledge management using Elasticsearch and ChatGPT,  
I have no plans to maintain, extend, or productionize it.

---

## 🏆 What It Was

ElasticSTAR was a personal knowledge database designed to:
- Parse and summarize professional experience data.
- Index it into Elasticsearch.
- Allow natural language querying via a CLI with ChatGPT-powered answers.

### Example Use Cases Included:
- Interview preparation with STAR-style responses.
- Personal knowledge retrieval.
- Context-aware querying of past work.

---

## 🛠️ Key Technologies
- Python
- Elasticsearch
- OpenAI’s ChatGPT API
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)

---

## ⚠️ Status
This project is **no longer maintained**.  
The code remains public as a reference or portfolio artifact,  
but it is **not recommended for active use without modification or extension**.

---

> Shipped. Learned. Moving on.

**ElasticSTAR** is a personal knowledge database built to index professional experiences and achievements, providing concise and context-rich answers to your questions. It leverages Elasticsearch for efficient data retrieval and ChatGPT for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), creating a powerful pipeline for querying and summarizing your personal knowledge.

---

## Features

- **Data Parsing and Summarization**: Parse professional experience data from various formats and send it through prompt-engineered requests to ChatGPT for consistent summaries and tagging.  
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Transform parsed data into a format suitable for indexing in Elasticsearch, enabling fast and accurate search capabilities.  
- **Query and Contextual Answers**: Use a Python CLI to ask questions, retrieve relevant documents from Elasticsearch, and get detailed answers enriched with context via ChatGPT.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combine Elasticsearch's search capabilities with ChatGPT's language understanding to create an efficient and intelligent Q&A pipeline.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: Input professional experience data from various formats (e.g., plain text, JSON).  
2. **Data Processing**:  
   - Parse and structure the data.  
   - Summarize and tag the data with relevant technologies, skills, and work themes using ChatGPT.  
3. **Indexing**: Store the structured and tagged data into Elasticsearch for fast retrieval.  
4. **Query Pipeline**:  
   - Use the CLI to ask a question.  
   - Query Elasticsearch to fetch the most relevant documents.  
   - Pass the documents and your question to ChatGPT for a detailed, context-aware response.

---

## Use Cases

- **Personal Knowledge Management**: Easily organize, retrieve, and query your professional achievements and experiences.  
- **Interview Preparation**: Quickly generate STAR-style responses based on indexed data for interview questions.  
- **Professional Insights**: Retrieve insights or examples of work you've done based on specific technologies or challenges.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Core language for development.  
- **Elasticsearch**: Backend for indexing and querying data.  
- **ChatGPT**: For summarization, tagging, and contextual Q&A.  
- **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interface for queries and interaction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+  
- Elasticsearch (local or cloud instance)  
- OpenAI API key for ChatGPT  

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elasticstar.git  
   cd elasticstar  
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
3. Configure Elasticsearch and OpenAI API:  
   - Update `config.yaml` with your Elasticsearch connection details and OpenAI API key.

## Usage

### CLI Commands

1. **Index Data**: Parse and index professional data into Elasticsearch:  
   ```bash  
   python elasticstar.py index --input data_file.json  
   ```

2. **Ask Questions**: Query your database for context-aware answers:  
   ```bash  
   python elasticstar.py query --question "Tell me about a time I optimized a system's performance."  
   ```

### Example Output
```plaintext  
Question: "Tell me about a time I optimized a system's performance."  
Answer: Based on your past experiences, one example includes optimizing test infrastructure by implementing Redis streams, which improved performance by reducing feedback time from 20 minutes to 30 seconds.  
```

---

## Roadmap

- Add a web-based interface for queries and data visualization.  
- Expand data formats supported for ingestion.  
- Integrate additional LLMs for summarization and analysis.  
- Enhance tagging with advanced NLP techniques for more precise categorization.
